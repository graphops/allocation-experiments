- [x] Random initializations versus x1 = 0. Same output?
- [ ] Random initializations versus x1 = 0. Same time to converge?
- [ ] How many iterations to converge when x1 = 0? k steps for k-sparse?
- [ ] Brute force (on small problem) versus PGO. Same output?
- [ ] If x1 = Halpern output, does the algorithm progress? (If so, then we have anecdotal improvement evidence)
